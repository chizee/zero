# Zero Update Flow

`zero update --check` checks the latest GitHub release for `Gitlawb/zero` and compares it with the local CLI version.

For M2 this command is intentionally check-only:

- It does not replace the running binary.
- It exits with code `0` when the check succeeds, even when an update is available.
- It exits with code `1` when the release check cannot be completed.
- `--json` prints the same result in a machine-readable format for scripts and CI.
- Release checks time out after 5 seconds by default.
- It validates that the latest release includes the expected archive and matching `.sha256` asset for the current platform.

The release endpoint resolves in this order:

- `Options.Endpoint` when calling `update.Check` from code.
- `ZERO_UPDATE_RELEASE_URL` from the environment.
- `https://api.github.com/repos/Gitlawb/zero/releases/latest`.

`options.endpoint` and `ZERO_UPDATE_RELEASE_URL` may be a full URL or an `owner/repo` slug.

Installer scripts download the matching release asset for the local platform and verify its `.sha256` file. If Zero is already installed, use this command before re-running the installer.
